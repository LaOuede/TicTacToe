<h3 align="left">🎯 Objective</h3>

<p align=left>
The objective of this project is to create a functional Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played in the browser. I have developped the core functionalities such as tracking player moves, checking for win conditions, and resetting the game. This project also help in understanding the module pattern and Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) in JavaScript.

<h3 align="left">📚 What I've learned</h3>

I've acquired a lot of basic knowledge with :

<h4 align="left">JavaScript</h4>

- **Module Pattern and IIFE**: Encapsulating game logic within modules to avoid global scope pollution.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically creating and updating HTML elements based on user interactions.
- **Event Handling**: Attaching event listeners to handle user inputs and game actions.
- **Game Logic**: Implementing algorithms to handle player moves, determine win conditions, and switch turns.
- **Closures**: Using closures to manage the game state and player information.
<h4 align="left">HTML & CSS</h4>

- **HTML5**: Structuring the game layout with semantic HTML tags.
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Creating a responsive layout for the game board and UI elements.
- **Styling**: Enhancing the visual appearance with custom styles and animations.
